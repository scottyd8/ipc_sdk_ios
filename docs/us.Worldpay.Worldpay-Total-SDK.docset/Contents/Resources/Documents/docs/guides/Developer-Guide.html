					<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The Worldpay Total Integrated Payment Client Software Development Kit
(IPC SDK) is a wonderful way for you to develop rich mobile applications
in the native language of the mobile device. We currently have SDKs for
iOS, Android, and Windows. Besides allowing you to develop native
applications, there are two other compelling reasons to choose this
platform:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We do all of the device management of your card reader. No need to
worry about device drivers. No Bluetooth management functions.
Nothing. We take care of those and report back to you when something
of interest happens.</p></li>
<li><p>You do not have to undergo EMV certification testing, because we
protect you from the card data. This would otherwise be a costly and
time-consuming activity.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The SDKs provide you with the glue necessary to talk with a card reader
(if you use one) and the code to make the remote calls to the Worldpay
Integrated Payments Hub.</p>

<p><img src="../images/WPTComponents.png" alt="Worldpay Total Components" /></p>

<p>Note that while one of the advantages to using the IPC SDK is the
management of the card reader, you can still use this library for card
not present applications or any other app that wants access to our
vault, tokenization, and customer management features. Think you might
one day move from card not present to card present? Develop against the
app today and rest comfortable that your app will be future-proofed when
you are ready to make the change – same code base.</p>

<p>The IPC SDK installs alongside your software - adding transaction
processing to your applications. It facilitates all transactional
communication between the Worldpay Integrated Payments Hub (IPH) and
approved hardware devices to isolate payment data and keeps it separate
from your software application.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong> Platform</strong> - iOS 8 and later</li>
<li><strong> Supported Devices</strong> - Miura M010 Shuttle</li>
</ul>


<h1>Overview of the Software Development Kit API</h1>

<p>Your starting point for all of the operations available in the IPC SDK
is the WorldpayAPI object. This object is a singleton accessible by the
instance method on the WorldpayAPI class.</p>

<h2>Securely Acquiring Card Information</h2>

<p>The IPC SDK manages all interaction with the attached card reader, and
then uses the card account information to perform transactions through
the Worldpay Total Integrated Payment Hub. The IPC SDK also provides a
way for you to manually enter card information for those times when the
card is not present for the transaction.</p>

<p>The IPC SDK supports the following methods to capture card information:</p>

<h2>Making Payments</h2>

<p>The following table shows the transactions you can use to manage
payments. The IPC SDK takes care of the network interactions with the
Integrated Payment Hub.</p>

<div class="tableheader">Payment Transaction Methods</div>


<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th> Function </th>
<th> Description </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td> Authorize </td>
<td> This call authorizes a transaction but does not capture the transaction for settlement. In a card-present environment, this option is most commonly used in serviceindustry transactions where an initial amount is authorizedprior to a gratuity being added. If the Authorization Onlycall is used, a subsequent Prior Auth Capture call must be made to capture the transaction for settlement.<br/><br/>See: [WorldpayAPI paymentAuthorize:withCompletion:] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Prior Auth Capture </td>
<td> This call allows a previously authorized transaction to be captured for settlement. In a card-present environment, Prior Auth Capture is commonly used when the transactionamount must be modified during capture, e.g., in the service industry when a gratuity is added to the original amount.<br/><br/>See:  [WorldpayAPI paymentCapture:withCompletion:] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Charge </td>
<td> This call authorizes the transaction and, if successful, captures it. This is the most common call for card-present transactions. (For some transactions, it may be necessary to separate these steps, e.g., in the service industry example described above. In such cases, separate calls to Authorize Only and Prior Auth Capture should be used instead of Charge.)<br/><br/>See:  [WorldpayAPI paymentCharge:withCompletion:]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Refund </td>
<td> The Refund method must be linked to a settled transaction. This is done by specifying the transactionId from the original Authorization or Charge as part of the request. By default, this method refunds the FULL amount of the transaction. However, you can perform a partial refund by passing a specific amount. If a refund is attempted on a transaction that has not yet settled, the Integrated Payment Hub will automatically run a Void on the transaction. The transactionType in this case will switch to Void.<br/><br/>See: [WorldpayAPI paymentRefund:withCompletion:] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Void </td>
<td> A void may be applied against any charge that has not yet settled; it effectively undoes the original authorization or charge as if it had never taken place.<br/><br/>See: [WorldpayAPI paymentVoid:withCompletion:] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Credit </td>
<td> A credit is a payment from a merchant account to  a credit card or checking account that does not have to be linked to a previous transaction. To use the Credit method, the merchant must be specifically enabled for it on the Worldpay Total platform. This is not recommended due to the risk of misuse. <br/><br/>See: [WorldpayAPI paymentCredit:withCompletion:] </td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h2>Controlling Settlement with Batches</h2>

<p>All transactions that have been authorized and captured are associated
with a batch. A batch is considered open until it is settled, which
completes the captured transactions and allows funds to be transferred
from the customers to the merchant. While open, transactions can still
be altered (i.e. voids, adding a tip). Once a batch is settled, it is
considered closed; no alterations can be made to transactions in a
closed batch.</p>

<p>In some cases, your account may be configured to automatically close out
all open transactions and start a new batch at a particular time every
night. However, you can close a batch at any time using the Close
method. The API also provides reporting methods that allow you to
retrieve details for both open and closed batches for a particular
merchant.</p>

<p>All batches are automatically closed at 4:00AM ET.</p>

<div class="tableheader">Batch Processing Methods</div>

<td> Retrieve the ID for the current batch<br/><br/>See: [WorldpayAPI getCurrentBatchWithCompletion:] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Retrieve Transactions in a Batch </td>
<td> Calling this method retrieves the transactions in the specified batch.  It returns an array of the transactions in the open batch, along with the full details of each asreturned during the original authorization.<br/><br/>See:  [WorldpayAPI getTransactionsInBatch:withCompletion:] </td>

<h1>Setting up Your Project in Xcode</h1>

<h2>Step 1 – Get the Lastest IPC SDK</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.github.com/worldpayus/ipc_sdk_ios/frameworks/WorldPaySDK_Miura.framework">Download</a>
 the latest IPC SDK framework for iOS from GitHub.</p>

<h2>Step 2 - Add the framework to your Xcode project</h2>

<ol>
<li>Select the “General” tab in your project’s settings</li>
<li>Press the “+” button under the “Embedded Binaries” section</li>
<li>Press the “Add Other …” button on the “Choose items to add dialog”</li>
<li>Navigate to the WorldPaySDK_Miura.framework file you downloaded in
the prior step and press “Open”</li>
</ol>


<p>This will copy the file into your project, add the embedded binary and
register the framework in your project. When you are done, the
configuration should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="../images/XcodeProjectConfiguration.png" alt="Xcode Configuration Page" /></p>

<h2>Step 3 – Add Your Device to Supported Protocols</h2>

<p>Add the Miura device to the supported protocols in your Info.plist file</p>

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the Info.plist file in your project</li>
<li>Left-click and add a “Supported external accessory protocols” row if
it doesn’t already exist</li>
<li>Add “com.miura.shuttle” to the list of protocols</li>
</ol>


<p>When you are done, the configuration should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="../images/XcodeProtocols.png" alt="Xcode Configuration Page" /></p>

<h1>Your Application</h1>

<p>Once the framework installed and the project has been configured, you
can begin to code your application. You can use the features of the IPC
SDK in a variety of ways to meet your payment needs.</p>

<p>To get you started here is a basic application flow:</p>

<ol>
<li>Register environment</li>
<li>Obtain an authorization token</li>
<li>Implement swiper delegate methods</li>
<li>Get card information and process the transaction</li>
<li>Handle the transaction response</li>
</ol>


<h2>Step 1 – Register Environment</h2>

<p>Before any calls to the API can be made, the environment must be registered using [WorldpayAPI registerEnvironment:]. It is best to do this in your AppDelegate&rsquo;s didFinishLaunching:withOptions: method, and once it has been set, it cannot be changed again during runtime.</p>

<h2>Step 2 – Obtain an Authorization Token</h2>

<p>Your application has to authenticate itself with the Integrated Payment
Hub before you can make payment transactions. The token is cached and
used for subsequent calls. This is called using
[WorldpayAPI generateAuthToken:withCompletion:] method which takes an
<a href="../../Classes/WPYAuthTokenRequest.html">WPYAuthTokenRequest</a> object as input. Note that this authentication token
represents the session with the Integrated payments Hub. It is not the
same thing as a tokenized payment method. You will need to provide your
secureNetId and secureKey (provided with your sandbox account) as
illustrated below.</p>

<p>Setting a terminal ID and/or terminal vendor with the auth token causes
that TID to populate automatically on all payments processed through the
terminal hardware. If a TID is not set, and not populated prior to
making a payment request, the terminal serial number will be used as the
TID.</p>

<pre><code>WPYAuthTokenRequest *request = [[ WPYAuthTokenRequest alloc ] init ]; 
request.secureNetId = self.secureNetId.text;
request.secureNetKey = self.secureNetKey.text;
request.merchantPartnersId = self.merchantPartnersId.text;
request.merchantPartnersPin = self.merchantPartnersPin.text;
request.applicationId = self.applicationId.text;
request.terminalId = self.terminalId.text;
request.terminalVendor = self.terminalVendor.text;

[ super showActivityIndicator ];

[[ WorldpayAPI instance ] generateAuthToken:request withCompletion:^(WPYAuthTokenResponse *response, NSError *error) {
    [ super hideActivityIndicator];
    if(response != nil &amp;&amp; response.authToken.length &gt; 0)
    {
        self.authToken.text = response.authToken;
    }
    else
    {
        UIAlertController *alert = [UIAlertController alertControllerWithTitle:@"Server Error" message:error.localizedDescription preferredStyle:UIAlertControllerStyleAlert];

        [alert addAction:[UIAlertAction actionWithTitle:@"Dismiss" style:UIAlertActionStyleDefault handler:nil]];

        [self presentViewController:alert animated:YES completion:nil];
    }
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
The IPC SDK calls the withCompletion block<a href="Blocks">^1</a> that you provide when the
response is returned from the Integrated Payment Hub.</p>

<h2>Step 3 – Implement Mandatory Swiper Delegate Methods</h2>

<p><a href="../../Classes/WPYSwiper.html">WPYSwiper</a> is a singleton class that represents the attached card reader.
Your application is notified about actions taken by the card reader
through methods on a <a href="../../Protocols/WPYSwiperDelegate.html">WPYSwiperDelegate</a> that you provide. The delegate
defines a number of callback methods, some of which are mandatory:</p>

<pre><code>/* This delegate function is called when the connection to the swiper hardware fails to be created*/
- (void) didFailToConnectSwiper:(WPYSwiper *)swiper;

/*This delegate function is called when the communication channel to the credit card terminal could not be opened, but will be reattempted */
- (void) willConnectSwiper:(WPYSwiper *)swiper;

/* This delegate function is called when an error has been detected when performing a requested task*/
- (void) swiper:(WPYSwiper *)swiper didFailWithError:(NSString *)error;

/*This delegate function is called after the terminal has generated the Transaction Certificate or Application Authentication Cryptogram and no more online requests are pending.*/
- (void) swiper:(WPYSwiper *)swiper didFinishTransactionWithResponse:(WPYPaymentResponse *)response;

/* This delegate function is called when an attempt to make a payment failed with a non-authorization related error.*/
- (void) swiper:(WPYSwiper *)swiper didFailRequest:(WPYPaymentRequest *)request withError:(NSError *)error;
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
For a full listing of swiper delegate methods, see <a href="../../Classes/WPYSwiper.html">WPYSwiper</a>.</p>

<h2>Step 4 – Get Card Information and Process Transaction</h2>

<p>The IPC SDK interacts with the card reader to prompt the cardholder
through confirming the amount of purchase and capturing payment card
information, either through inserting the card in the chip reader, or by
swiping it and reading the track data. Your application simply has to
initiate the transaction, and the IPC SDK takes care of the rest:</p>

<pre><code>WPYSwiper *swiper = [[ WorldpayAPI instance] swiperWithDelegate:delegate;
[ swiper connectSwiperWithInputType:WPYSwiperInputTypeBluetooth];

// After "didConnectToSwiper:" callback
WPYPaymentAuthorize *request = [[ WPYPaymentAuthorize alloc] init];
request.amount = [ NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:@"10.00" ];

// Sale with cashback enabled. Use WPYEMVTransactionTypeGoods for sale without cashback enabled.
WPYEMVTransactionType type = WPYEMVTransactionTypeCashback;

// This handles both contact and magnetic stripe. If a chip enabled card is used the SDK
// will prevent processing unless there are no supported Application Ids or
// if the chip fails to read and requires technical fallback.
[ swiper beginEMVTransactionWithRequest:request transactionType:type];

//Handle payment errors
(void)swiper:(WPYSwiper *)swiper didFailRequest:(WPYPaymentRequest *)request withError:(NSError *)error
    {
    }

//Handle processed payment
(void) swiper:(WPYSwiper *)swiper didFinishTransactionWithResponse:(WPYPaymentResponse *)response;
    {   
    //Clear the screen of the "Approved" or "Declined" message when ready
    [ swiper swiperClearDisplay];
    }
</code></pre>

<h2>Step 5 – Handle the Response</h2>

<p>When the transaction response is received from the Integrated Payment
Hub, WPYSwiper will call either the <a href="../../Protocols/WPYSwiperDelegate.html#//api/name/swiper:didFinishTransactionWithResponse:">[WPYSwiperDelegate swiper:didFinishTransactionWithResponse:]</a>
or the <a href="../../Protocols/WPYSwiperDelegate.html#//api/name/swiper:didFailRequest:withError:">[WPYSwiperDelegate swiper:didFailRequest:withError:]</a> methods on the <a href="../../Protocols/WPYSwiperDelegate.html">WPYSwiperDelegate</a> you provided.
You can look in the returned <a href="../../Classes/WPYPaymentResponse.html">WPYPaymentResponse</a> for information related
to the transaction such as whether it was approved or declined. The
responseMessage attribute provides a detailed description of the
response.</p>
