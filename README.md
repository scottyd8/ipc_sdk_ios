# Worldpay Integrated Payment Client for IOS (Beta)

## Building the Sample Application
The quickest way to see the Integrated Payment Client SDK in action is with the sample application.

### Quick Win
1.  Get the [sample app](http://github.com/worldpayus/ipc_sdk_ios/tree/master/sampleapp) 
2.  Open the project *WorldpaySDKDemo.xcodeproj* in Xcode, build it and run it in the simulator

You can run the app in the iOS simulator and exercise the functions that don't require a device.

### With a Card Reader
You can use the card reader on your iOS device:

3.  Deploy the app on your iOS device
4.  Connect your card reader to your iOS device via bluetooth
5.  Run the app

## More Information
You can find the Getting Started Guide, full documentation of the SDK object library, as well as Application Notes on our [iOS documentation library](https://worldpayus.github.io/ipc_sdk_ios).
